<title>Gamer's Mindset</title>

<h1 style="color:green;"><b>Gamer's Mindset</b></h1>
<br>
<p style="color:black;">When playing league,its not all about everything in game,theres the outside too.When it comes to games in general,people tend to forget the fact that there is a pyschological aspect when playing games.The first thing you should do to have a proper mindset to playing league is following these three steps.One,NEVER underestimate your opponent until you have had proper knowledge on them.Getting cocky is pretty much only gonna get you lower in elo every game.If youre that yasuo that only focuses on fighting your opponent and spamming that mastery level 7 that will only get you tilted and flamed.Not to mention that lose more as well.Two,if you act as if you are better than everyone in your game and every single game you will NEVER climb.If you portray yourself as a god then you wont see your flaws and your weaknesses.Also if you portray yourself as a god,then let me ask you this,why are you still stuck in that elo?Three,take breaks.If you keep playing while being tilted that will only make you play worse and make you lose more elo.If you lose a few games,then go take a break and do something relaxing.Four,never BM.BMing only increases your opponent's awareness of you and makes you a bigger threat which could really screw you over in a match if youre playing a carry role like adc or mid.And finally,NEVER flame your team.Toxicity really can be the difference between a loss and a win.Some people just want to keep their pride so much to the point where they would make their whole team lose just for it.Asian professional teams always win over the western teams,but why?The answer is simple.Asian teams do not bm or boast about their victories,nor bite back at the trash talk they recieve.They improve off the criticism and become even better than before.Western teams do not even bother considering the insults they get and instead fight with the people that insulted them.</p>

<h2 style="color:green;">Tips for untilting</h2>
<p style="color:black;">Now I dont know if these tips can help you,but you can try them and see if you wanna try them out.Usually at least one of these things help me calm down.</p>
<ul>
<li>Playing a different game that is not competetive or relaxing to you.</li>
<li>Watching movies/videos or reading stories/manga with a really good story.</li>
<li>Taking a walk.</li>
<li>Taking a shower.</li>
<li>Doing something youre passionate about.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3 style="color:green;">Additional options</h3>
<p style="color:black;">Listening to music is probably the thing that calms me down the fastest.To me,theres nothing better than the feeling a beats going through my ears and sending sensations of calmness throughout my body.</p>
